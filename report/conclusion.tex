\section{Conclusion}

This project explored the use of machine learning for classifying particle
events as gamma or hadron. By utilizing various libraries in Python and
implementing different classification algorithms, the project achieved
promising results.

Further exploration could involve:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fine-tuning hyperparameters for each model to improve performance.
    \item Trying additional classification algorithms like Random Forest or
    Gradient Boosting.
    \item Investigating feature engineering techniques to create new features
    potentially improving classification.
\end{itemize}
